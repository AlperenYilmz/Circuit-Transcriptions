# Description
- I re-scheme circuits from PCBs, as a hobby.
- In this repo, you will find accurate and carefully-done transcriptions I do from PCBs of various devices. I work with KiCAD 9, so each content will have schematic file in **kicad_sch** extension and remarks/notes if applicable.
- Repo will grow gradually, as much as I can comtribute.
